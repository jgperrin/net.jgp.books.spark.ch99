# HUD USPS ZIP Codeâ„¢ crosswalk files

Welcome to Spark in Action, 2e, chapter 12. This chapter is about **data transformation**.

The dataset can be downloaded as a feed from the [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html). It is maintained by the Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R).

This directory contains COUNTY_ZIP_092018.xlsx and COUNTY_ZIP_092018.csv. The Excel file was downloaded from the HUD website (during the government shutdown of 2019). I opened the file and saved it as a CSV. Spark will exploit the CSV file.

All examples are in Java.
